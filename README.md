Blixtlåset Electronics App

Welcome to our mobile app that helps kids learn electronics by creating circuits on their phone!

With this app, students can experiment with building different circuits and learn about the basic principles of electricity and electronics. The user-friendly interface allows students to easily drag and drop components to create working circuits.

The app is designed for the Blixtlåset competition, which encourages students to explore and learn about technology and engineering. Our goal is to make learning about electronics fun and engaging for kids.

Some features of the app include:

A variety of circuit components to choose from
Step-by-step tutorials to guide students through building different circuits
Quizzes to test student's understanding of the concepts covered

We hope you enjoy using our app and learning about electronics! If you have any questions or feedback, please contact us at [email address].

Happy building!
